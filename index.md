### <ins>About Me</ins> 
![My photo|512x397,20%](https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/43/12/34/360_F_243123463_zTooub557xEWABDLk0jJklDyLSGl2jrr.jpg) 

###### I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen.  I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like countryâ€™s peace, I like metropolisâ€™ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
###### I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote "Les Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote "John Christopher". They have influenced millions of people through their books. I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read peopleâ€™s mind. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.
